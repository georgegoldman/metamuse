# MetaMuse

## Overview
The **MetaMuse** is a decentralized application that allows artists to collaboratively create digital artwork in real-time, mint it as a non-fungible token (NFT) on Lisk, and distribute fractional ownership using Arbitrum. This platform ensures transparent royalty distribution and shared ownership, empowering artists to collaborate creatively and securely.

## Features
- **Real-time Collaborative Canvas**: Multiple artists can create and edit artwork in real-time.
- **NFT Minting on Lisk**: The completed artwork is minted as an NFT on the Lisk blockchain.
- **Fractional Ownership on Arbitrum**: Ownership shares and royalties are distributed among collaborators via Arbitrum smart contracts.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Artwork and metadata are stored on IPFS for decentralized, secure storage.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Lisk, Arbitrum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Forge
- **Backend**: Lisk SDK, IPFS (Pinata or Infura)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- [Lisk SDK](https://lisk.io/)
- [Arbitrum Development Environment](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/)
- [IPFS CLI](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/)
- [Foundry & Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/collaborative-nft-art-platform.git
   cd collaborative-nft-art-platform
   ```
Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Set up IPFS:

Use Pinata or Infura for IPFS API keys to store artwork and metadata.
### Running the Application
Start the local development server:

```
npm start
```
**Launch Lisk and Arbitrum nodes:**

Follow setup instructions for Lisk SDK and Arbitrum.
Deploy the Arbitrum smart contracts with Forge:

Ensure Forge is installed and set up by following the Foundry book.

**Deploy contracts from the contracts folder:**
```
forge create --rpc-url <ARBITRUM_RPC_URL> --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> src/YourContract.sol:YourContract
```
### Smart Contract Development
Smart contracts in this project handle:

Fractional Ownership: Distributing shares among contributors.
Royalty Distribution: Automatically redistributing royalties to collaborators on resale.
Smart contracts are located in the contracts/ directory. Forge scripts for testing and deployment can be added in script/.
